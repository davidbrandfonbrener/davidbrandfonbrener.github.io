I'm a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) studying machine learning with [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) in the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) at the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/) at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/). I am interested in scalable and provable learning for decision making problems. Specifically, I have been working on provable guarantees in online and offline reinforcement learning with function approximation. I am also interested in transfer learning, representation learning, and the generalization and optimization of neural networks. My work is supported by an [NDSEG](https://www.ndsegfellowships.org/) fellowship.

I've also interned at [FAIR](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) in Paris working with [Alessandro Lazaric](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6JZ3R6wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matteo Pirotta](https://teopir.github.io/) on efficient exploration. I did my undergrad at [Yale](https://www.yale.edu/) where I double majored in [Math](https://math.yale.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) where my various advisors were [Andrew Barron](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/), [Dana Angluin](https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dana-angluin), [John Murray](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/murray/john_murray.profile?source=news), and [Pat Devlin](https://math.yale.edu/people/patrick-devlin).
