I'm a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) studying machine learning with [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) in the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) at the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/) at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/). I am interested in scalable and efficient learning for decision making problems. Recently I have been mostly working in the offline reinforcement learning setting, trying to understand when and how we can learn effective policies from fixed datasets. I have also worked on provable guarantees for reinforcement learning with function approximation and am interested in representation learning, transfer learning, and the generalization and optimization of neural networks. 

My work is supported by an [NDSEG](https://www.ndsegfellowships.org/) fellowship. I've interned at [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/) in virtual Montreal working with [Romain Laroche](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rolaroch/) and [Remi Tachet des Combes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/retachet/) on offline RL and at [FAIR](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) in Paris working with [Alessandro Lazaric](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6JZ3R6wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matteo Pirotta](https://teopir.github.io/) on efficient exploration. And I did my undergrad at [Yale](https://www.yale.edu/) where I double majored in [Math](https://math.yale.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) where my various advisors were [Andrew Barron](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/), [Dana Angluin](https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dana-angluin), [John Murray](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/murray/john_murray.profile?source=news), and [Pat Devlin](https://math.yale.edu/people/patrick-devlin).
